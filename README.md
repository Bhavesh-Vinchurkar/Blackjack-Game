# Blackjack Game
 In Blackjack, every player is competing against the dealer—not each other. In a given round, the player’s ultimate goal is to get a hand that’s higher than the dealer’s (without being higher than 21, or "busting"). Only by beating the dealer can a player win their bet. Players determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards.
